      <h2>News Management System for the University of Peradeniya</h2>
      <hr>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        Before implementing my system, if a lecturer wants to submit a news item/advertisement to the university web site it would normally take more than 4-5 days, since, it had to undergo several authentications and proof readings (Department head, Faculty Head, University Editor, Deputy Vice Chancellor and Web Master). Most of the times this process was done manually and in other times electronically via emails and thus takes a lot of time to complete and the original sender has no idea about the status of the item. And sometimes the final document drastically different from the original document due to a lot of editing in-between the process. And once the process has finished, web developer must build a web page from scratch each time when a news item arrived. So I had to build a system to simplify this task and automate the process as much as possible.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        So I developed a system which, a lecturer/employee of the university can login using their own university email addresses and passwords and post a news item with other relevant documents (images, pdf etc.). Then the system will automatically notify the relevant Faculty Head using email, and then faculty head must log in to the system and approve the item. If faculty head had to do some editing to the news item, it will be notified to the original sender with the new changes. And then the item will be directed to the next level and so on. At the end, web developer will be notified and he has to log into the system and check whether everything is according to the order and approve the item, once webmaster approved the item it will automatically published in the University site without having to manually develop a page. Once the system was introduced, it was very quick and easy to submit a news to the university site. The whole system was developed as a mobile friendly application which enabled users to use it on the go. And this system was directly helped University of Peradeniya to <b>rank up</b> in the university web ranking by <b>200</b> ranks at the time.

      <p style="text-align:justify">
        I was asked to develop a project to capture geo spatial data using an android smart phone and build a wireframe of the space in order to help an interior architecture for his day to day work. With my application the user can take accurate distances of the room just by targeting the smartphone camera to a corner of the room without having to manually measure the distances. And then place the objects in the room using the same method. Then the application will be able to create a wireframe of the current room, allowing user to rearrange, add and delete the objects inside the room so that the room will utilize the maximum possible space available. After completing, the user can save the map on the web server and edit it later on if necessary and is able to share the wireframe using any relevant application installed on phone (Bluetooth, WhatsApp, Viber and email etc.).</p>

      <h2>Weather Information Portal for the Government of Myanmar</h2>
      <hr>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        This project was done as a request of Myanmar Government. They needed a system which can be used to access weather information for past 30 years which they had already gathered. Weather data like Minimum/Maximum Temperatures and Rainfall were some of the information they gathered. There was a massive amount of data, for an example, there were around 26 stations that captured all these 3 data types in each hour of a given day for 30 years. And they also required a method to predict the weather of a place with reference to the already observed data. And they also had an intention of selling some of these datasets to some parties (students, researchers and government bodies etc.) as well.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        So we (a team of 5 developers) started this project and after few discussions, designed the architecture of the system. And my major focus was to develop a library to display different kinds of data using various methods like charts, maps etc. and handling the CSV files, printing and downloading those data. Within 2 months of time, we had the system up and running and now, the system is being used by the government of Myanmar.
